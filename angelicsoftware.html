          <p>Angelic Software is a small startup attempting to change the way
            people navigate social interaction.</p>
            <p>
            My role as lead UX Designer was to design user flow and interactions within the application via
             production of wireframes and prototypes, as well as conducting research
             into the market receptivity of the product. I conducted 2 surveys and
             built prototypes on a weekly basis to be discussed and reviewed
             by the project lead and stakeholders.</p>

        <div class="col-md-6 col-md-offset-3">
          <p>This project started from the concept that we as people do not give
          as much time to the significant people in our lives as much as we should.
        Dead bedrooms arisen from having children or parents and grandparents forgotten
      as we move on in our adult lives seem to be commonplace stories in our modern world
      where technology affords us instant gratification and distraction. Our
        team wanted to address this by using technology to improve our relationships with
        the people in our lives.</p>
        <img src="./resources/Survey.png" width="100%" style="border:1px solid darkgrey" alt="survey_results">
        <p>To see if our theory that people have trouble maintaining relationships, we
          distributed a survey to friends, family, and Reddit. The results were conclusive:
          people have trouble staying in touch. Whether it be from being too busy, to
          merely not remembering to call, we have many reasons why we fail to
          inform the people we care about just how important they are to us.</p>

        <div class="col-md-6 col-md-offset-3">
          <p>With our mission goals defined, we needed to figure out what would be the
            quickest and simplist implimentation of what we were trying to acheive. Initial
            developer goals were crude, essentially building a conversational engine to
            generate nice things to say. The other designer and I felt that this would be
            received poorly by family and friends, on the grounds that people receive
            enough spam today, they don't need it from their loved ones.</p>
          <p>We did issue another survey regarding the reception of such canned lines
            and people were not as offended by the thought as much as we initially predicted. I
            believe this to be a result of survey takers not having a clear example of what
            canned conversation looks like, but I conceded to the data and we decided to maintain some generational
            features.

            <p>For our MVP, we concluded that our MVP would consist of a relationship manager
              where the user can set interval reminders, take notes, and bookmark anniversaries and other
              special dates.</p>

        <p>After discussing the potential of our product, we decided that one of our
        key features should be how we prioritize communications with people. For example,
      we wanted to be able to ensure that we never miss a birthday or anniversary, so events of
    that nature would be shuffled to the top, and then sorted by last message sent. Subsequent messages
  would be sorted only by last message sent, in reverse chronological order(most recent at the bottom).</p>

    <p>All mockups were produced with Sketch and prototyped in both Invision and Adobe XD. This project is currently on hiatus.</p>
